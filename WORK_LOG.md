| April 5 |    9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Jan 23  | 4:00-4:30pm  |                                                                                                 During this time I began to think about how I could approach this problem set. I am trying to focus on what is actually being counted and this made me first think of using a simple approach of trying every possible seqence of coins. Even though I am sure that this is not the correct way to approach it, I think that if if I could break the problem into smaller problems like making change for smaller values then i could try and build up to a bigger value. |
| Jan 24  | 12:15-1:15pm | As I continued to think about this problem set, I noticed that each way of making change can be viewed as almost a seieres of choices about which coins to use and how many times to use them. So, this is making me think of approaching this problem set from a rescurisve perspective. Each step can involve choosing a coin and then reducing the target amount. My thinking changed during this time as I realized that once a coins is chosen, I may need to restrict future choices to stop from counting the same combination multiple times in different orders. |
| Jan 27  | 8:00-9:00pm  |                                I am still unsure of how to increase the efficency for approaching this problem set. The large target values are starting to make me think about if I can somehow incoorporates recognition of patterns into my solution. For example if I can find the same smaller target values that might be resued many times when building up to a bigger normal. I am not entirely sure how I would actually express this in code but that is another thought I that came to during this time in addition to recurisive idea that I previously had. |
