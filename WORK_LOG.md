| April 5 |    9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Jan 23  | 4:00-4:30pm  |                                                                                                                                   During this time I began to think about how I could approach this problem set. I am trying to focus on what is actually being counted and this made me first think of using a simple approach of trying every possible seqence of coins. Even though I am sure that this is not the correct way to approach it, I think that if if I could break the problem into smaller problems like making change for smaller values then i could try and build up to a bigger value. |
| Jan 24  | 12:15-1:15pm |                                   As I continued to think about this problem set, I noticed that each way of making change can be viewed as almost a seieres of choices about which coins to use and how many times to use them. So, this is making me think of approaching this problem set from a rescurisve perspective. Each step can involve choosing a coin and then reducing the target amount. My thinking changed during this time as I realized that once a coins is chosen, I may need to restrict future choices to stop from counting the same combination multiple times in different orders. |
| Jan 27  | 8:00-9:00pm  |                                                                  I am still unsure of how to increase the efficency for approaching this problem set. The large target values are starting to make me think about if I can somehow incoorporates recognition of patterns into my solution. For example if I can find the same smaller target values that might be resued many times when building up to a bigger normal. I am not entirely sure how I would actually express this in code but that is another thought I that came to during this time in addition to recurisive idea that I previously had. |
| Jan 30  | 9:35-9:55am  |                                                                                          During this time I began my final attempt and began implementing the memoization approach. I started by setting up my base cases and one thing that I missed at first was to return 1 at the start if my target was 0. Intuitively this now makes a lot of sense to me because there is only one way to make zero, but was something that I missed and is a way that my thinking changed. I also knew that I needed to use a 2D array for my memoization and made sure to implement that as well during this time. |
| Jan 31  | 4:00-5:00pm  |                                                                     During this time I competed my memoization approach. While I was writing this approach, my thinking was to either include the coin and reduce the amount, or exlucde the coin and move to smaller peices. I then used the 2D array that I had previously filled to store each sum at a certain index. My thinking changed during this time as I realized that I when I exclude a number I actually need to change the coinIndex when I iterate recursively. Once I fixed this error I was able to complete the my memoization approach. |
| Feb 1   | 1:00-1:45pm  | During this time I began to work on my tabulation approach. I started out by using an array that stores the number of ways to make each possible sum up to the target and started with the base case. My thinking changed during this time since I initally made a mistake in how I updated the table that caused everything to be counted twice since my for loops order allowed the same set of coins to be form different orders. However, I then fixed this so that I process coins one a time and update sums smaller to large values. Once I made this change I was able to complete the problem set. |
